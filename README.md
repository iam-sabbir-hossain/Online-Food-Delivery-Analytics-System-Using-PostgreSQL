# Online-Food-Delivery-Analytics-System-Using-PostgreSQL
This project is a PostgreSQL-based database for managing and analyzing an online food delivery platform.
It consists of 7 interconnected tables — Customers, Restaurants, Menu_Items, Delivery_Person, Orders, Order_Details, and Payments — linked with foreign keys to maintain data integrity.
The system stores detailed information about customers, restaurants, menu items, orders, deliveries, and payments.

A set of analytical SQL queries is implemented to extract business insights, such as:

-Most ordered food items

-Restaurants with the highest average order value

-Most active customers

-Popular payment methods

-Highest-priced menu item per restaurant

-Peak ordering days

-Customer retention rate month-to-month
